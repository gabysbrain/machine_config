  # NOTE: Nextcloud has a console client occ which can be used to install and

  # - If Nextcloud has already been installed, installation script fails because
  #   the admin user already exists. Thus, the installation script cannot be
  #   used for already installed Nextcloud instances.
  #
  # - If apps directory isn't writable (apps directory in nix store),
  #   installation fails. The console client could be used to set a different
  #   apps directory which is writable but this is possible only after
  #   installation. Thus, this setting must be written to config.php without the

    # IMPORTANT NOTICE
    #
    # If the user changes `cfg.path` for an already installed Nextcloud, the
    # installer is run because no existing config file was found. However, the
    # installation will most likely fail because stuff already exists in the
    # database but the installer tries to create database tables. This requires
    # manual work from the user: the old path must be moved to the new path,
    # otherwise all `data`, `config` and other mutable directories will remain
    # in the old location and they are not found nor used by the newly
    # configured instance. Thus, it is strongly recommended NOT to change
    # `path` after the Nextcloud instance has been installed.  Perhaps, we
    # should generate a helper script `nextcloud-movePath` which would just
    # move the current `cfg.path` to a new given location and then the user can
    # change the value in nix configuration?
    #
    # If the user changes the database type or name, access to the current
    # Nextcloud database is lost. Thus, it is strongly recommended NOT to change
    # `dbType` nor `dbName` after the Nextcloud instance has been installed.
    # Perhaps, we should generate a helper script `nextcloud-databaseChange` and
    # `nextcloud-databaseRename` to help the user with those tasks? After using
    # those, the user should make changes to the nix configuration. `occ
    # db:convert-type` can be used to convert from one DB type to another but
    # not within the same type. Use DB type specific renaming for that.
